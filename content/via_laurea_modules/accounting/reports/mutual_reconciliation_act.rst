Mutual Reconciliation Act
=========================

Introduction
------------

Mutual debt reconciliation acts (EUR) can be generated in detailed form - with all transactions, or in summary form - including only the overall result of the specified period. To generate a reconciliation act for a specific partner/client, you can find this report in the Accounting module by selecting Reports/Partner Ledger.
