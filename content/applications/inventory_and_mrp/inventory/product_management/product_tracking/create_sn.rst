Detailed Operations
===================

Serial numbers can be assigned to products when entering stock for the first time, from the
:guilabel:`Detailed Operations` page on the receipt. Receipts can be accessed by navigating to
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations --> Receipts`.

.. important::
   Serial numbers can **not** be assigned to products on a request for quotation (RfQ) or purchase
   order (PO) — **only** on a receipt.

Assign a single serial number to a product by clicking the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` smart

product.

the :guilabel:`Open: Stock move` pop-up window.

.. image:: create_sn/generate-serials.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show generate serials button.

Doing so opens the :guilabel:`Generate Serial numbers` pop-up window, where the first serial number
is entered in the :guilabel:`First SN` field to generate a sequence of serial numbers, based on the
first serial number entered.

For more details on how to fill in this pop-up window, :ref:`refer to this section
<inventory/product_management/assign-sn>`.

Import Serials
--------------

Assign multiple serial numbers at once by clicking the :guilabel:`Import Serials/Lots` button in the
:guilabel:`Open: Stock move` pop-up window.

.. important::
   If the button is not visible, ensure the :guilabel:`Create New` option is selected in the
   :ref:`receipt's configuration page <inventory/product_management/configure-new-serials>`.

Doing so opens the :guilabel:`Import Lots` pop-up window. Enter each serial number on a separate
line in the :guilabel:`Lots/Serial numbers` text field.

.. tip::
   Copy/paste serial numbers from an existing excel spreadsheet and add them to the
   :guilabel:`Lots/Serial numbers` text field.

   .. image:: create_sn/copy-from-excel.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Show excel sheet to copy serial numbers from.

Tick the :guilabel:`Keep current lines` checkbox to add serial numbers to the list of products, and
serial numbers in the :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number` table, in the :guilabel:`Open: Stock move`
pop-up window. To replace the serial numbers in the list, leave the :guilabel:`Keep current lines`
option unchecked.

Finally, click :guilabel:`Generate`.

.. example::
   For a receipt with a :guilabel:`Demand` of `3.00` products, one product has already been assigned
   a serial number in the :guilabel:`Open: Stock move` pop-up window.

   So, in the :guilabel:`Import Lots` pop-up window, two serial numbers, `124` and `125` are
   assigned to the remaining products by entering the following in the :guilabel:`Lots/Serial
   numbers` input field:

   .. code-block::

      124
      125

   The :guilabel:`Keep current lines` option is selected to add these two serial numbers **in
   addition** to the serial number, `123`, that has already been assigned.
