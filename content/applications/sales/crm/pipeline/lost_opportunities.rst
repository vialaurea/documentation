Manage lost opportunities
=========================

Not every opportunity results in a successful sale. To keep the pipeline up-to-date, *lost*
opportunities need to be identified. Specifying why an opportunity was lost provides additional
insight that can prove useful for future opportunities.

Mark an opportunity as lost
===========================

To mark an opportunity as lost, first open the :menuselection:`CRM app`, and select an opportunity
from the pipeline, by clicking on its corresponding Kanban card. Doing so reveals that opportunity's
detail form.

Then, click :guilabel:`Lost`, located at the top of the opportunity's detail form.

   :alt: Buttons from the top of an opportunity record with the lost button emphasized.

This opens the :guilabel:`Mark Lost` pop-up window. From the :guilabel:`Lost Reason` drop-down menu,
choose an existing lost reason. If no applicable reason is available, create a new one by entering
it into the :guilabel:`Lost Reason` field, and clicking :guilabel:`Create`.

Additional notes and comments can be added below the lost reason in the designated
:guilabel:`Closing Note` field.

.. tip::
   Neither the :guilabel:`Lost Reason` field, nor the :guilabel:`Closing Note` field, on the
   :guilabel:`Mark Lost` pop-up window are required. However, it is recommended to include this
   information for the sake of traceability, accountability, and reporting purposes.

When all the desired information has been entered in the :guilabel:`Mark Lost` pop-up window, click
:guilabel:`Mark as Lost`.

After clicking :guilabel:`Mark as Lost`, a red :guilabel:`Lost` banner is added to the upper-right
corner of the opportunity.
