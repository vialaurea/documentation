.. _activities/activity:

Activity view
-------------

Most applications in Odoo have an *Activity* view available. If available, a :guilabel:`üïò (clock)`
activity icon is visible in the top-right of the main menu bar.

To open the activity view, click the :guilabel:`üïò (clock)` activity icon.

.. image:: activities/activities.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Top-right menu with the Activities icon called out.

In this view, all the available activities are listed in the columns, while the horizontal entries
represent all the individual records.

Activities that appear green have a due date in the future, activities that appear orange are due
today, while activities appearing red are overdue.

Color bars in each column represent records for specific activity types, and display a number
indicating how many activities are scheduled for that type.

If multiple activity types are scheduled for a record, a number appears in the box, indicating the
total number of scheduled activities.

.. note::
   Activity colors, and their relation to an activity's due date, is consistent throughout Odoo,
   regardless of the activity type, or the view.

To schedule an activity for a record, hover over the corresponding field, and a :guilabel:`‚ûï (plus
sign)` appears. Click the :guilabel:`‚ûï (plus sign)`, and then :ref:`fill out the Schedule Activity

.. _activities/form:

Schedule Activity form
----------------------

Activities can be scheduled from many different places, such as from the :ref:`chatter
<activities/chatter>` of a record, or from one of multiple views in an application, when available:

  options are: :guilabel:`Email`, :guilabel:`Call`, :guilabel:`Meeting`, or :guilabel:`To-Do`.
  Depending on what other applications are installed, additional options may be available.

  .. note::
     Individual applications have a list of dedicated :ref:`activity types <activities/types>`. For
     example, installing the *Sales* application makes :guilabel:`Order Upsell` available, while
     installing the *Sign* application makes :guilabel:`Request Signature` available.

- :guilabel:`Summary`: enter a short title for the activity, such as `Discuss Proposal`.
- :guilabel:`Due Date`: using the calendar popover, select the activity's deadline.

When the :guilabel:`Schedule Activity` pop-up window is completed, click one of the following
buttons:

  Click on the desired date and time for the activity, and a :guilabel:`New Event` pop-up window

  field.

  Enter the information in the :guilabel:`New Event` pop-up window, then click :guilabel:`Save &
  Close` to schedule it. Once scheduled, the activity is added to the chatter under the
  :guilabel:`Planned Activities` section.

  .. important::
    The :guilabel:`Open Calendar` button **only** appears if the :guilabel:`Activity Type` is set
    to either :guilabel:`Call` or :guilabel:`Meeting`.

- :guilabel:`Schedule`: schedules the activity, and adds the activity to the chatter under
  :guilabel:`Planned Activities`.
- :guilabel:`Schedule & Mark as Done`: adds the details of the activity to the chatter under
  :guilabel:`Today`. The activity is not scheduled, and is automatically marked as done.

application the activity is to be completed. Each sub-section lists the number of scheduled
activities that are :guilabel:`Late`, due :guilabel:`Today`, and scheduled in the
:guilabel:`Future`.

   In the *Time Off* application, one activity is scheduled to be done in the *All Time Off*
   requests dashboard, and six activities are scheduled to be done in the *Allocations* dashboard.

   These requests appear in two separate lists in the all activities drop-down menu: one labeled
