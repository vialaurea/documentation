After doing this, approve the entry. If already working employees are uploaded to the Odoo system with already accrued vacations (e.g., previously using other software for payroll), it is also necessary to make 2 entries, as in the hiring case. In this case, in the first entry, enter the already accrued vacations up to this day, following the description of the first working day entry. In the second entry, assign the accrual based on the applicable vacation norm for the employee. **NOTE:** If you forgot to enter vacation accrual entries when hiring an employee, calculate how many vacations the employee has accrued until this day, and enter the obtained number when entering the regular vacation assignment for the first working day."
