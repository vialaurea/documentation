"UAB Via Laurea has developed a plugin for the standard Planning module, "
"enabling a broader application of this module for Lithuanian work time "
"accounting needs. The Planning module is intended for creating work "
"schedules and shifts, accurately determining work hours when the work "
"time is irregular or cumulative work time accounting is applied. The "
